## Sframe

SFrame library

## createClient

Create a new SFrame client context.

This method will create client which communicates with web worker in which the SFrame context will be executed.

### Parameters

-   `senderId` **[Number][1]** Numeric id for this sender.
-   `config` **[Object][2]** Congiguration parameters [Optional].
    -   `config.skipVp8PayloadHeader` **[Boolean][3]** Sends the vp8 payload header in clear (Note: it will be applied to all video frames as encoded chunks does not contain codec info yet).
    -   `config.displayFailedDecryptionFrames` **[Boolean][3]** Will display frames even when decryption has failed, leading to a garbled video being displayed.

Returns **[Promise][4]&lt;[Client][5]>** Promise that resolves to the client object when the web worker is initialized.

## Client

**Extends EventTarget**

The SFrame client object which acts as a proxy for web worker context.

### setSenderEncryptionKey

Set the sender encryption key.

#### Parameters

-   `key` **([ArrayBuffer][6] \| [Uint8Array][7] | CryptoKey)** 32 bytes encryption key. If the value is a CryptoKey the algorithm must be "HKDF".

Returns **[Promise][4]&lt;void>** Promise which will be resolved when the key is set on the web worker.

### ratchetSenderEncryptionKey

Ratchert the sender encryption key.

Returns **[Promise][4]&lt;void>** Promise which will be resolved when the key is ratcheted on the web worker.

### setSenderSigningKey

Set the sender signing key.

#### Parameters

-   `key` **([ArrayBuffer][6] \| [Uint8Array][7] | CryptoKey)** Private key used for singing. If the value is a CryptoKey the algorithm must be "ECDSA".

Returns **[Promise][4]&lt;void>** Promise which will be resolved when the signing key is set on the web worker.

### addReceiver

Add receiver for a remote sender.

#### Parameters

-   `receiverkKeyId` **[Number][1]** The remote senderId.

Returns **[Promise][4]&lt;void>** Promise which will be resolved when the receiver is added on the web worker.

### setReceiverEncryptionKey

Set the receiver encryption key associated to a remote sender.

#### Parameters

-   `receiverkKeyId` **[Number][1]** The remote senderId.
-   `key` **([ArrayBuffer][6] \| [Uint8Array][7] | CryptoKey)** 32 bytes encryption key. If the value is a CryptoKey the algorithm must be "HKDF".

Returns **[Promise][4]&lt;void>** Promise which will be resolved when the key is set on the web worker.

### setReceiverVerifyKey

Set the receiver signing key associated to a remote sender.

#### Parameters

-   `receiverkKeyId` **[Number][1]** The remote senderId.
-   `key` **([ArrayBuffer][6] \| [Uint8Array][7] | CryptoKey)** Private key used for singing. If the value is a CryptoKey the algorithm must be "ECDSA".

Returns **[Promise][4]&lt;void>** Promise which will be resolved when the signing key is set on the web worker.

### deleteReceiver

Remove receiver for a remote sender.

#### Parameters

-   `receiverkKeyId` **[Number][1]** The remote senderId.

Returns **[Promise][4]&lt;void>** Promise which will be resolved when the receiver is removed on the web worker.

### encrypt

Encrypt frames for a RTCRtpSender.

#### Parameters

-   `id` **[String][8]** An unique identifier associated to this sender (for example transceiver.mid).
-   `sender` **RTCRtpSender** The sender object, associated track must be not null.

### decrypt

Decrypt frames fpr a RTCPRtpReceiver.

#### Parameters

-   `id` **[String][8]** An unique identifier associated to this sender (for example transceiver.mid), it will be used for the authentication and signing events.
-   `receiver` **RTCRtpReceiver** The receiver object.

### close

Close client and terminate web worker.
